# better-video

## known bugs

- yt home screen doesn't load
- some videos with controls still visible
- after initial load the new videos inserted aren't detected
- seek tooltip behind the overlay
- volume changes after click and drag but tooltip stay behind the overlay, and the ux isn't so good
- volume slider out the container
- cast button pending functions (future chromecast/wvc)
- multiple styles created in page

## future (maybe not)

- slide volume dragging right with volume inside animated pin with pop up, fade out, and drag animations
- enable disable overlay option
- custom settings per page
- subtitles with formatting (maybe not)
